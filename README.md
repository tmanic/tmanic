# 👋 Hey, I'm Tevin

I'm a data science enthusiast with a background in epidemiology and biostatistics. I enjoy solving real-world problems using data, from understanding public health trends to building statistical models that make sense of uncertainty.

📍 Based in: Kenya  
🧠 Focus Areas: Statistical Modeling • Bayesian Inference • Evidence Synthesis  
📚 Background: Epidemiology • Biostatistics • Public Health Research


🔬 What I Work On

- 🧪 Bayesian & Frequentist Modeling  
  Building models that go beyond p-values — including multilevel models, logistic regression, and Bayesian inference using `brms`, `rstanarm`, and `Stan`.

- 📚 Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analysis  
  Synthesizing evidence using tools like `metafor`, `meta`, and Bayesian network meta-analysis frameworks.

- 📈 Data Visualization & Communication  
  Turning complex data into clean, interpretable insights using `ggplot2`, `seaborn`, and tidy data workflows.

- 📦 Reproducible Research
  Writing clean, transparent, and reproducible reports using **R Markdown**, **Quarto**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**.
